# so_long
so_long is a project that aims to create a basic 2D game using the MinilibX graphics library. The game involves navigating a character through a map to collect items and reach an exit. This project deepens understanding of window management, event handling, and basic game mechanics.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/clemllovio/so_long.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory and compile

## Usage
To run the game:
```
./so_long maps/map.ber
```
Where `ma[.ber` is a valid file for the game.

## Map Configuration
The map must be constructed with 3 components:

  • Walls (1)

  • Collectibles (C)

  • Free space (0)



The map must contain:

  • 1 exit (E)

  • At least 1 collectible (C)

  • 1 starting position (P)

## Controls

• `W` or Up Arrow: Move up

• `S` or Down Arrow: Move down

• `A` or Left Arrow: Move left

• `D` or Right Arrow: Move right

• `ESC`: Quit the game

## Credits
This project was developed by Clémence Llovio as part of the curriculum at 42 School.
